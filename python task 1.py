#problem statement: write a python program that does the following
# 1.take two numbers as input from the user
# 2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers: Addition	Subtraction Multiplication Division
# 3. display the results of each operation on the screen

Num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
Num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

Addition = Num1 + Num2
Subtraction = Num1 - Num2
Multiplication = Num1 * Num2
Division = Num1 / Num2 

print("Addition:", Addition)
print("Subtraction:", Subtraction)
print("Multiplication:", Multiplication)
print("Division:", Division)
